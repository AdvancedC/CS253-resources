===================

PLEASE COMPLETE THIS README FILE PER NORMAL STANDARDS!

To run the test programs you will need to set the paths to find the library:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./lib

Then run the test programs as follows:
First, run a simple smoke test:

testsuite/SimpleTestList

Next, run the incomplete unit test. You will need to add to it.

testsuite/UnitTestList

Finally, run a larger test that uses the list.

testsuite/RandomTestList


Each program takes command line arguments and will give a help message if run
without the command line arguments.
